## This app was created with the help of Streamlit!
It's only dependencies are scsims https://github.com/braingeneers/SIMS and the streamlit package.
If the app is live you can access it at https://sc-sims-app.streamlit.app/.
You only need a single cell dataset in the shape of an h5ad file to get started.
Upload your file to the streamlit server, select the model you want to use to perform your predictions and download your results!
